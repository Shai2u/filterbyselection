# Filter by Selection

## Description:

Filter by Selection is a QGIS plugin designed to enhance spatial analysis by allowing users to quickly filter one layer based on the selected feature and attribute from another layer, or a spreadsheet table. This tool provides a seamless way to apply attribute-based filtering, thereby enabling more precise and targeted data visualization and analysis within QGIS. The tool adds intuitive layer filtering, enabling users to quickly apply filters by a reference feature or attribute, significantly speeding up the process compared to manual filtering. This can cut the time to 1-2 seconds per filter, avoiding the need to open the filter window.

### Usage Scenarios:

• Urban Planning:
Filter land parcels or zoning areas based on specific characteristics from another layer, such as population density or land use types.

    •	Choose the source layer that contains the features and attributes you want to use for filtering.
    2.	Select Target Layer:
    •	Choose the target layer that you wish to filter based on the selected features and attributes from the source layer.
    3.	Select Features and Attributes:
